# QB_Salaries.RMD

This file compares quarterback efficiency to how much they are paid annually.
Using nflfastR play by play data and other packages, I follow the steps below to make a valid chart comparing the two variables:
1. Import contracts
2. Filter by QB's and ensure the annual salary is their last signed contract
3. Join your contracts and teams together to ensure you'll have the logo for each player
4. Upload and join play-by-play and roster data
5. When you are filtering out the statistics to measure QB efficiency, make sure you choose the most relevant or important, in a sense. For quarterbacks, I chose:
    a) Quarterback EPA/play
    b) Completion % over expected
6. Make the plot your own!
7. The two plots represent the correlation between annual salaries and quarterback efficiency for 2018-22, and then for just 2023 up until the beginning of Week 15. 


# RB_Salaries.RMD

This file compares running efficiency to how much they are paid annually.
Using nflfastR play by play data and other packages, I follow the steps below to make a valid chart comparing the two variables:
1. Import contracts
2. Filter by RB's and ensure the annual salary is their last signed contract
3. Join your contracts and teams together to ensure you'll have the logo for each player
4. Upload and join play-by-play and roster data
5. When you are filtering out the statistics to measure RB efficiency, make sure you choose the most relevant or important, in a sense. For quarterbacks, I chose:
    a) Total EPA/play
    b) Running back EPA/play, comparing home versus rush EPA
6. Make the plot your own!
7. The two plots represent the correlation between annual salaries and running back efficiency for 2018-22, and then for just 2023 up until the beginning of Week 15.
